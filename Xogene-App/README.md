# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Running the Project Locally

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Start the development server:
bash : npm start

or if you're using yarn:

bash : yarn start
Open your web browser and go to:

http://localhost:5173/drugs/search

You should see React application running!
